# Development Timeline & Execution Strategy

## Weekend Sprint (48 Hours)

### Day 1 (Saturday)
- **Hour 1-2**: Extension scaffolding and VS Code API setup
- **Hour 3-6**: Markdown parsing for task detection
- **Hour 7-10**: Basic button rendering above task items
- **Hour 11-14**: VS Code agent API integration

### Day 2 (Sunday)
- **Hour 1-4**: Prompt construction (steering docs + task)
- **Hour 5-8**: Task completion state management
- **Hour 9-12**: Basic error handling and testing
- **Hour 13-16**: MVP packaging and initial testing

## Polish Week
- **Monday-Tuesday**: Edge case handling and stability
- **Wednesday-Thursday**: UI polish and user experience
- **Friday**: Documentation and marketplace preparation
- **Weekend**: Launch preparation and marketing

## AI-Assisted Development Strategy
- Use AI to generate boilerplate VS Code extension code
- Leverage AI for markdown parsing logic
- AI-assist for VS Code API integration patterns
- Automated testing generation

## Weekend Lock-In Mindset
Time pressure creates:
- Focused execution without overthinking
- Decision-making efficiency under constraints
- Scope discipline through resource limitations
- Momentum building through rapid progress

## Risk Mitigation
- **Weekend failure**: Scope reduction to absolute minimum
- **Technical blockers**: Pre-research VS Code API capabilities
- **Perfectionism trap**: Strict adherence to MVP principles
